## Docker Image
I am lazy and like to use [pre-made containers for computer vision development](https://github.com/salinaaaaaa/NVIDIA-GPU-Tensor-Core-Accelerator-PyTorch-OpenCV). 
```
docker pull jhoeller/computer-vision
``` [via](https://hub.docker.com/r/jhoeller/computer-vision)

It's kind of hefty and assumes there is an NVIDIA GPU.
